## SideQuest      
First, you will need to clone this repository, and after that, cd into it and install the dependencies by running `yarn install`      
Then, before you can get it running, you will need to download the ExpoGo app on whatever phone you are using to test. Download ExpoGo from the app store, open the app on your phone, and then make an account on it.    
Now you can run our app. In the command line on your computer, run `npm run start:wsl_localcli_cacheclear`, and then leave that running in the terminal. Now when you open ExpoGo on your phone, the app called SideQuest should appear at the top. When you click it, it should launch our app on your phone!     

        
Common solutions to common problems - if the app does not appear in ExpoGo, then make sure that your phone and computer are connected to the same WiFi. This is not always required, but it often solves the not found issue.
