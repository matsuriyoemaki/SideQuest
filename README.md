## SideQuest      
First, you will need to clone this repository, and after that, cd into it and install the dependencies by running `yarn install`      
Then, you will need to download the ExpoGo app on whatever phone you are using to test. You will need to make an account on it. Whatever username you use for Expo, you will need to put into the app.json file for this project at the owner "owner" key - change it from Markatron9000 to whatever yours is.       
Finally, if you run `npm run start:wsl_localcli_cacheclear`, the compiled app will appear on the ExpoGo app on your phone to test!
